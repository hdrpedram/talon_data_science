# TaLON Data Science

### Hello, Data Science Cohort!

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the **Foundations of Data Science** module. In this repo, you'll find all the materials you need for our first session.

### Key Resources

- **Notebooks**:  
  We’ll be working with two important Jupyter Notebooks in our lab session:
  1. `data_prep.ipynb` – for data preparation
  2. `exploratory_analysis.ipynb` – for exploratory data analysis

- **Datasets**:  
  While you’ll see some datasets here, don't worry about them just yet! We’ll download and create them together during our lab session.

### Getting Started

Before class, please complete the following:

1. **Clone this repository**: Save the main folder locally on your computer.
2. **Open in Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**: Once cloned, open the folder in VSCode and create a project.
3. **Set up Jupyter Notebook**:  
    - Install the Jupyter Notebook extension in VSCode.  
    - Ensure you have Python 3.12 or any version later than 3.10 installed. Select the correct Python kernel when opening the notebooks.

### First Assignment (Before Class)

Your first task is to research how to:
- Clone/download a GitHub repository.
- Set up Jupyter Notebook in VSCode and add a Python kernel.

### See you soon!
